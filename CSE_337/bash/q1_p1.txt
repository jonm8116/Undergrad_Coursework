Multiple commands
command: 	32 18 7 * * echo "" >> /home/update.txt 
			32 18 14 * * echo "" >> /home/update.txt 
			32 18 21 * * echo "" >> /home/update.txt 
			32 18 28 * * echo "" >> /home/update.txt 
6.
find . -type f -size +2000c

7.
Command: ls | grep .gz | wc -l 
i) I first navigated to the directory /usr/share/man/man1 and
then used the command above in order to count the number of 
files that were in the file. There are 771 files in the directory with a 
.gz extension.
ii) Command used: ls -l | wc -l 
					ls -l | grep "\->" | wc -l
I had used the first command in order to count the total number of files
in the directory. Then I used the bottom command to get the total number of
symbolic links. There was 171 symbolic links and 772 total files. So there is 
601 non symbolic link files.

8. cat /usr/share/dict/words 
-c bytes
-m chars
-l lines
-w words
